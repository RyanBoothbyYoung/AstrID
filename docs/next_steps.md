# Steps to Enhance Your Project

## 1. Understand the Vizier Data
- **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the columns and data provided by the Vizier catalog you are using.
- **Actions**:
  - Review the catalog documentation to understand the meaning of each column.
  - Identify key columns such as `HIP`, `RAhms`, `DEdms`, `Vmag`, `B-V`, `_RA.icrs`, and `_DE.icrs`.
  - Document the data structure and any important notes in your README or a separate documentation file.

## 2. Integrate Vizier Data with Image Data
- **Objective**: Ensure that the star data fetched from Vizier corresponds to the stars in the image.
- **Actions**:
  - Use the WCS (World Coordinate System) information to map pixel coordinates to sky coordinates.
  - Match the coordinates of the stars in the Vizier data with the pixel coordinates in the image.
  - Overlay the WCS grid on the image to visually confirm the alignment.

## 3. Preprocess the Data
- **Objective**: Prepare the image and star data for analysis.
- **Actions**:
  - Normalize the image data to ensure consistent intensity values.
  - Extract relevant features from the image and star data.
  - Create labeled datasets for machine learning, including features like brightness, color index, and coordinates.
  - Handle any missing or inconsistent data.

## 4. Develop a Classification Algorithm
- **Objective**: Identify different types of stars using a classification algorithm.
- **Actions**:
  - Start with a simple classification algorithm (e.g., decision tree, k-nearest neighbors).
  - Use libraries like OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for machine learning.
  - Implement feature extraction techniques to derive meaningful features from the data.
  - Document the algorithm and its implementation in your repository.

## 5. Train and Evaluate the Model
- **Objective**: Train your classification model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance.
- **Actions**:
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
  - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
  - Iterate on the model by tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different algorithms to improve accuracy.

## 6. Search for Black Holes (Stretch Goal)
- **Objective**: Extend the classification model to search for black holes.
- **Actions**:
  - Research advanced techniques and additional data sources for black hole identification.
  - Integrate new features and data into the existing model.
  - Train and evaluate the extended model to identify potential black hole candidates.
  - Document the process and findings in your repository.

## Additional Steps
- **Documentation**: Continuously update your README and other documentation files to reflect the progress and changes in the project.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage contributions from the community by providing clear guidelines in a CONTRIBUTING.md file.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
