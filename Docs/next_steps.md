Steps to Enhance Your Project
1. Understand the Vizier Data: Familiarize yourself with the columns and data provided by the Vizier catalog you are using. This will help you understand what information is available for each star.

2. Integrate Vizier Data with Image Data: Ensure that the star data fetched from Vizier corresponds to the stars in the image. This involves matching the coordinates of the stars in the Vizier data with the pixel coordinates in the image.

3. Preprocess the Data: Prepare the image and star data for analysis. This may include tasks like normalizing the image, extracting features, and creating labeled datasets for machine learning.

4. Develop a Classification Algorithm: Start with a simple classification algorithm to identify different types of stars. You can use libraries like OpenCV for image processing and scikit-learn for machine learning.

5. Train and Evaluate the Model: Train your classification model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance. Iterate on the model to improve accuracy.

6. Search for Black Holes: Once you have a robust classification model, you can extend it to search for black holes. This will likely involve more advanced techniques and additional data sources.
