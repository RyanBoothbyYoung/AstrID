# Requirements

- Needs to solve an existing data science/machine learning problem
    - Which you must describe and justify
    - Why is it interesting to pursue?
    - What are the most salient challenges?
    - Don't mention time or organization
- Dataset
    - Is a dataset readily available?
        - Does it fit the needs of the project?
        - How will you obtain it?
        - Does it require preprocessing? Any clean up/missing fields?
    - Will you create your own?
        - What are the downsides of this approach
    - An ideal dataset rarely exists
        - Reflect on the pros/cons of the ideal case and the data you are using
- Don't focus on the implementation itself yet:
    - What conclusions would you like to arrive to?
    - What types of ML algorithms would you use?
        - I am expecting that this will change during the course of the project 
- Python-based
- Hosted on the CSCI servers
